# Kube-proxy: Networking Component

Kube-proxy is a critical component of the worker node that handles networking for Pods and Services.

## Role:

- Maintains network rules to route traffic to appropriate Pods.
- Implements Kubernetes Services by managing IP tables or IPVS rules.
- Ensures Pods can communicate within the cluster (east-west traffic) and with external clients (north-south traffic).

## Placement:

Kube-proxy runs as a daemon on every worker node in the cluster.

## How It Works:

- Monitors the Kubernetes API for updates to Services and Endpoints.
- Configures the network stack (e.g., iptables) to route traffic based on these updates.

## Example:

When a Service is created, kube-proxy ensures requests sent to the Service's ClusterIP or NodePort are forwarded to the correct backend Pods.
